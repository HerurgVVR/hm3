Combined Inbox, unread, and flagged message views for all your E-mail accounts (and
RSS feeds), as well as normal E-mail client folder navigation.
      </li>
      <li>
          Search all your E-mail accounts and RSS feeds at once with a simple form.
      </li>
      <li>
Pages are comprised of only 3 HTTP requests totaling ~40KB (gzipped).  Data to
populate a page from different sources is collected with parallel AJAX
requests. Output is validated HTML5 and local storage (session only) is used to
cache content for speedier reloads.  All the little interface icons use
data-urls so they are served inline.
      </li>
      <li>
All the work of processing a request and providing a response is done with
module sets. The application framework manages module assignment and provides a
controlled execution environment, but modules are where the actual work is done.
      </li>
      <li>
Simple interface translation system that does not use gettext or .po files, just
arrays of translated strings defined in PHP. Currently all translations are seeded
with strings from the Google Translate API. Right to left langauges are supported.
      </li>
      <li>
Currently modules for IMAP and POP3 are pretty robust, and the SMTP module set
is functional but still under development.
      </li>
      <li>
Sessions and user data can be stored in any PDO compatible database or flat
files on the server. Authentication is flexible and currently supports POP3,
IMAP, or an included database schema. Sessions and Authentication were built to
be overridden for site specific needs without breaking module sets.
      </li>
      <li>
On the server, page request processing peaks at around 2-4MB of memory. The module system
only includes PHP files required to process the current request, so time is not
wasted parsing unused code paths.
      </li>
      <li>
There is a build process that pre-calculates module assignments and combines
and compresses page assets.  There is also a developer mode in which individual
components are included directly for easy debugging and development.
      </li>
      <li>
The application framework weighs in at about 1800 lines (SLOC) and has 100% unit test coverage with PHPUnit (there are still a few missing assertions).
      </li>
