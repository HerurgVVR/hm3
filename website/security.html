Session level data is encrypted with a long random string generated each time you login.
</li>
<li>
Persistant data stored between logins is encrypted with your clear text password, which is not stored anywhere on the server or in the session.
</li>
<li>
All cookies are session level, HTTP only, and have the secure flag, path, and domain values set.
</li>
<li>
All encryption is AES compliant using PHP MCRYPT with tunable knobs.
</li>
<li>
TLS everwhere - forced TLS for browsers, and TLS/STARTTLS support for IMAP, POP3, and SMTP connections.
</li>
<li>
HTTP request header fingerprinting and dynamic session ids.
</li>
<li>
Built in nonce checking for all HTTP POST requests, including AJAX based requests. It is not possible for modules to override the nonce check.
</li>
<li>
Security related HTTP headers like X-XSS-Protection, X-Content-Type-Options, and Content-Security-Policy.
</li>
<li>
An optional two factor authentication module that uses a free SMS 2fa service from Swipeidentity.
</li>
<li>
Only white-listed and typed/sanitized input is allowed. Modules must pre-define input in order to have access to it.
</li>
<li>
Modules have no access to PHP super-globals, and there are no globally scoped variables at all (there are a few static class instances with private data structures that use getter/setter methods).
</li>
<li>
PHP ini settings are tightened up for extra security, including open basedir and session best practices.
</li>
<li>
No writable files or directories are used inside the webserver document root, and only 3 files need to be insde the document root to run the program.
</li>
<li>
Optional local DB based authentication uses PBKDF2 hashing.
</li>
<li>
Easy ouput escaping inside modules for potentially dangerous content.
</li>
<li>
Configurable idle timeout module set that ends a session after a predetermined amount of idle time.
</li>
<li>
Module design enforces a separation of input processing and output formatting, and encourages concise methods, which makes the code easier to debug and audit.
</li>
