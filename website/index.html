Cypht is an Open Source webmail application written in PHP and JavaScript that speaks native IMAP, POP3, and SMTP.
Cypht is a third generation E-mail client born from the ashes of the Hastymail project. Like the projects that preceeded it,
its focus is security, speed, and simplicity. In that order. Cypht is lightweight in the browser and on the server, and has
an evolving feature set. Cypht has a modular design that provides an unprecendented level of site specific customization
options. Questions or comments can be sent to jason [at] hastymail [dot] org.
