      <h3 class="top">Overview</h3>
      Cypht has a modular design. Instead of an application with a plugin API, Cypht is an application
      comprised entirely of plugins, or as we call them, "module sets". There is only one required set,
      the "core" modules. These can be added to, or even replaced, by site specific modules. All the
      functionality of Cypht is broken out into module sets, and each set is built from small pieces
      that are also easy to override. The module system is powerful, but also a bit complex. First let's
      take a look at the module sets that come with Cypht:<br /><br />
      <ul>
          <li><b>account</b><br />Provides UI features to create accounts and for users to update passwords (when using the built-in DB authentication).</li>
          <li><b>calendar</b><br /> Basic calendar with no event support yet.</li>
          <li><b>contacts</b><br /> Contact management. Currently unwritten.</li>
          <li><b>core</b><br /> Handles basic page layout, logging in and out, and the default settings pages.</li>
          <li><b>feeds</b><br /> Allows users to add RSS/ATOM feeds to their content sources.</li>
          <li><b>idle_timer</b><br /> Uses a polling mechanism to keep the PHP session alive, and to end it at the designated time.</li>
          <li><b>imap</b><br /> Allows users to add IMAP accounts to their content sources.</li>
          <li><b>info</b><br /> Adds support pages like "Help", "Bugs", and "Development" to the Settings menu.</li>
          <li><b>pop3</b><br /> Allows users to add POP3 accounts to their content sources.</li>
          <li><b>profiles</b><br /> Create profiles with specific user information and associated IMAP/POP3/SMTP servers. Currently unwritten.</li>
          <li><b>smtp</b><br /> Send outbound E-mail. This module is functional but buggy.</li>
          <li><b>swipe_2fa</b><br /> Really cool 2-factor authentication module set using the SwipeIdentify free 2FA service.</li>
        </ul>
        Module sets are setup in the hm3.ini file. With the exception of the core module, they can all be enabled or disabled independently. When the site build process is run, module assignments are calculated and saved in the configuration file (so they don't need to be re-calculated at run-time). There is also a debug mode in which modules are activated dynamically (for the most part) to make development easier.
        <h3>File Structure</h3>
        Module set names in the ini file match the directory the module code is in under modules/. Files in a module have pre-defined names. Any other required code should be included from one of these files.
        <br /><br /><ul>
            <li><b>setup.php</b><br />This is where a module set defines it's own modules and assigns them to request identifiers. This file must return an array of valid input and associated types in order for the module code to have access to it..</li>
            <li><b>modules.php</b><br />This is where the actual module code lives. If you have external libraries to include this is a good place to do so.</li>
            <li><b>site.js</b><br />Optional file to include JavaScript for the module set.</li>
            <li><b>site.css</b><br />Optional file to include CSS for the module set.</li>
        </ul>
        In debug mode the module site.css and site.js files are included directly if they exist. In production mode combined and optionally minified versions are used consisting of a single js file and a single CSS file generated by the build process. Minifying programs can be specified in the hm3.ini file.
        <h3>Input and Output</h3>
        There are two kinds of modules: Input processing modules called "handler modules", and output formatting modules called "output modules". Modules can pass data to each other, and output modules have access to all the data input modules create. The typical job of a handler module is to analyze user input and do some work based on it. The typical job of an Output module is to take the results of an input module and format it for the browser. Let's use a simple "Hello World" example to illustrate how a complete module set works.
